# Setup Guide

### Detailed guide on how to reference any of the packages in your project. By using `EzSaver` package as example, same steps are applicable to other packages containing an `Assembly Definition Asset` file.

*Without further ado, I'd assume you already downloaded and imported the package into your project*.

### Adding Package Reference
*After you had imported this package, you need to reference in your project. Kindly skip this step If you are not using an `Assembly Definition Asset` in your project*.
	
To proceed, click on your project's `Assembly Definition Asset` file, under `Assembly Definition References` click the `(+)` icon below and add **EzSaver** reference, then apply changes below:

### Configuring Debug Logs
 *Log messages issued from this package may not appear without explicitly enabling them*:
	
 - Under  `Project Settings` > `Player` > `Other Settings`  `Scripting Define Symbols` 
 - Hit the `(+)` icon trice and for each entry add:  `ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG` | `ENABLE_DEBUG_WARN` | `ENABLE_DEBUG_ERROR`  and hit apply:

*Be sure to clear the entries above when you're set to build your project, hence, by hitting the `(-)` icon for each entry*.

### Calling APIs
>Once the above steps are properly setup, you're ready to start utilizing the package's public APIs.
	
>Be sure to include: `usingÂ Racer.EzSaver;` or `using Racer.pkg_Name;` to any external class calling any of the package's public APIs. 
	
>An optional demo Scene may be contained in the package and will probably walk you through, you can also omit to import it.
