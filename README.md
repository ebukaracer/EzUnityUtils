### Side Notes
The primary focus of this repository is to aid game development speed and avoid reinventing the wheel. While it's primarily focused for my personal reference in future projects, I have decided to make it public and easily accessible for anyone in need of any feature it offers.

Also, none of the packages are officially supported or endorsed by Unity, use at your own risk.

### Contribution
Contributions are welcome, especially those that enhance accessibility and usability. Feel free to fork, modify and make pull requests!
